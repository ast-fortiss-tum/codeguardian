The function checks if task is the current task (if (task == current)) 
and then updates the debug control MSR (Model-Specific Register). 
This check introduces a potential race condition.

If the task status changes after the check but before the MSR update, 
it could lead to inconsistent or unintended behavior. 
This is a common concern in systems programming where multiple threads 
or processes might modify shared resources.
