The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for this kind of vulnerability is CWE-259: 
Use of Hard-coded Password. 

However, CWE-798 is "Use of Hard-coded Credentials," which is a broader category encompassing 
the use of any fixed set of credentials within a program.
This includes hard-coded passwords (CWE-259), as well as other types of credentials 
like cryptographic keys or usernames.

Thus, making CWE-798 the appropriate classification, with CWE-259 being a more specific instance 
within that broader category.
