The line char *stored_password = ""; suggests that the password is initially set to an empty string. 
If this variable is meant to store a hardcoded password, this practice is vulnerable. 

Hardcoding credentials within the application's source code can lead to unauthorized access if the codebase is exposed. 
It's safer to store such sensitive information in a separate and secure configuration file or environment variable, 
and even then, it should be encrypted.
