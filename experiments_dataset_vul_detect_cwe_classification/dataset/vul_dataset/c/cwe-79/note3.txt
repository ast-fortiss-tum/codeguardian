The function directly inserts the contents of text into the HTML without any sanitization or escaping. 
If text contains HTML or JavaScript code, it will be rendered as-is by the browser. 
This behavior can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts 
into web pages viewed by other users. 
To mitigate this issue, any content that will be inserted into HTML should be properly escaped 
to neutralize any potentially harmful characters or scripts.
