The script constructs a JavaScript function that dynamically creates hidden form inputs based on data retrieved from sessionStorage. 
The key and value for these inputs are decoded using str_decode(), but there's no explicit sanitization or encoding of 
the content from sessionStorage before it's inserted into the DOM.
