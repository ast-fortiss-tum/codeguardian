In the first conditional block, data is set to NULL.
In the subsequent conditional block, data is dereferenced without checking 
if it's NULL. This is where the null pointer dereference occurs, 
as *data is used in printLongLine(*data).

When a program attempts to use a null pointer to access or modify data, 
it can lead to undefined behavior, including program crashes or other vulnerabilities.
