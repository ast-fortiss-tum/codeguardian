1. NULL Pointer Assignment: In the source label, data is explicitly set to NULL.
2. Dereferencing NULL Pointer: In the sink label, the code attempts to access data->intOne, 
where data is a NULL pointer. This will lead to undefined behavior, 
often resulting in a segmentation fault or crash of the program.
