The `s` parameter, which represents the encoding, is directly used without explicit validation. 
If CZNC::Get().FixupEncoding(s) does not properly validate or sanitize the input, 
it could potentially lead to issues. For example, if an attacker can control the input, 
they might provide a malicious encoding string that exploits a vulnerability in the handling of encodings. 
It's important to ensure that any input is validated and sanitized appropriately, especially when it comes from an untrusted source.
