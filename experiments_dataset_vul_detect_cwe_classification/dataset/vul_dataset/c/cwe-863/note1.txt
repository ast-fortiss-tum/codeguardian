1. Anonymous Binding: The use of anonymous binding (i.e., without providing a username and password) 
in LDAP can lead to security risks, especially if the LDAP server contains sensitive information. 
Anonymous binds are often used for read-only access to public information, but if the LDAP server is not properly configured, 
it could inadvertently allow access to sensitive data or functionalities that should be restricted.

Lack of Authentication: By not authenticating users, the application may grant access to resources without verifying the identity of the user. 
This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or functions.
