The function func allocates memory for data, initializes it, 
and then frees it within the first if block. 
However, in the second if block, you attempt to access data again by passing 
its first element to printLongLine. 
At this point, data points to a memory location that has been freed. 
This can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, 
or even execution of malicious code by exploiting the freed memory space.
