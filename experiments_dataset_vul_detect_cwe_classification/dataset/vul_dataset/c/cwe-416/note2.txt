The code allocates memory to data and then frees it within the first if block. 
However, in the second if block, it attempts to use data again by passing it to printLine. 
At this point, data points to a memory location that has been freed, 
which can lead to undefined behavior and potentially to security vulnerabilities 
like crashes or execution of malicious code.
