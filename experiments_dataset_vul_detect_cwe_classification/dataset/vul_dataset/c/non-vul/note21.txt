Data Initialization: The variable data is properly initialized before use.

Buffer Overflows: There doesn’t seem to be any risk of buffer overflows as there are no operations 
that write to an array or memory block.

Format Strings: The printf function is used correctly with a constant format string, 
so there’s no risk of format string vulnerabilities.

Control Flow: The control flow of the program is straightforward and doesn’t seem to have any issues.
