The fgets(dest, DEST_SIZE, stdin); line reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in the dest buffer. 
The number of characters read is limited by DEST_SIZE, which prevents a buffer overflow.

Moreover, the code checks if fgets returned NULL, which would indicate an error condition. 
If fgets returns NULL, the program prints an error message and exits, which is a good practice for error handling.

Finally, the line dest[DEST_SIZE-1] = '\0'; ensures that dest is null-terminated, 
which is crucial when working with strings in C to prevent reading beyond the end of the string.
