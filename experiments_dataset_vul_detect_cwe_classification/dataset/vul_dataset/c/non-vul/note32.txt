The variable data is a pointer to long. In the first if condition, 
it is correctly initialized to the address of tmpData, which is a local variable. 
This is a good practice to avoid using an uninitialized pointer.

Use of STATIC_CONST_TRUE: This seems to be a macro or a constant that is always true. 
If so, both if blocks will always execute. The use of such constants usually indicates 
the code is either simplified for example purposes or is undergoing some form of 
conditional compilation.

Lifetime of Pointed-to Object: The object tmpData to which data points has a lifetime 
that extends to the end of the func() function, ensuring that data is not pointing to 
a deallocated or out-of-scope variable when it's dereferenced.
