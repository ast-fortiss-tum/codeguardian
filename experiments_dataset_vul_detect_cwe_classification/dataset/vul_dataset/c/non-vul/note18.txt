The function uses fputws, which is a standard library function and is generally considered safe. 
It doesn’t suffer from common vulnerabilities like buffer overflow.

The function checks the return value of fputws and handles the error case, which is a good practice.
The goto statement is used, which is generally discouraged in modern programming due to 
its potential to make code harder to understand and maintain. However, in this small function, 
its use doesn’t introduce a vulnerability.
