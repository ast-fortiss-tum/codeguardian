The code declares an array id_sequence with a size of 3 (int id_sequence[3];). 
In C, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the valid indices for this array are 0, 1, and 2. 
However, it is attempting to access id_sequence[3], which is outside the bounds of the array. 
This fourth element access is writing data to a memory location that is not allocated for id_sequence, 
which can lead to undefined behavior, including corruption of adjacent memory, crashes, 
and potential security vulnerabilities.
