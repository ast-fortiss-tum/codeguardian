// This snippet is classified as CWE-78, which is a child of CWE-77.
The issue arises from concatenating user-supplied input (in this case, argv[1]) directly into a command string 
that is executed by the system function. This practice can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. 
For example, if an attacker provides an argument like "; another_command", 
it would result in executing another_command on the system, in addition to the intended cat command.
