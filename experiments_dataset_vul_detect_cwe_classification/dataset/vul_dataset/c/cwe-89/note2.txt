SQL Injection occurs when an attacker can influence the SQL query in a way that was not intended by the developer. 
In your code, sprintf is used to concatenate user inputs (username and the result of request.Lookup("item")) 
directly into the SQL query. If these inputs are not properly sanitized, an attacker could craft malicious input to manipulate the query, 
leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
