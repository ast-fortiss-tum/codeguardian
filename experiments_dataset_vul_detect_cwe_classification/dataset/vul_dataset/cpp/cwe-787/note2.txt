In your code, the memcpy function is used to copy data from the in buffer to the buf buffer. 
The number of bytes to be copied is controlled by the user-input value bytes. 
Since there's no check to ensure that bytes does not exceed the size of the buf array (which is 64 bytes), 
a user could input a value that causes memcpy to write data beyond the bounds of buf. 
This is a classic example of an out-of-bounds write, as the excess data would overflow into adjacent memory space, 
potentially overwriting important data or control information.
