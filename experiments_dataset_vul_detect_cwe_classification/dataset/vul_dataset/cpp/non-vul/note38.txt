1. Stack Buffer Usage and strcpy: The code correctly initializes a stack buffer dataBuffer of 100 characters 
and copies the string "hostname" into it using strcpy. Because the string "hostname" is well within the size limits of dataBuffer, 
there is no buffer overflow risk here. However, strcpy is generally considered unsafe because it does not check buffer sizes, 
which could lead to vulnerabilities if the copied string were longer than the buffer. In this specific case, 
it's not vulnerable due to the controlled environment and fixed string length, but best practices recommend using safer alternatives 
like strncpy or memcpy with explicit size checks.

2. Pointer and Reference Manipulation: The function uses a reference to a pointer (char * &dataRef) to indirectly manipulate the data pointer. 
This technique is not inherently unsafe, but it can lead to confusion and mistakes in more complex codebases. In this snippet, 
dataRef is effectively used as an alias for data, and the inner block re-declares a local data pointer that shadows the outer data pointer. 
This shadowing is unnecessary for the operation performed and could lead to errors in more complex scenarios, 
but it does not introduce a vulnerability in this context.
