1. Memory Allocation with ALLOCA: The use of ALLOCA for memory allocation is notable. 
ALLOCA allocates memory on the stack, which is automatically freed upon function return. 
This approach is generally faster than heap allocation but comes with its own set of risks. 
Stack memory is limited, and excessive allocation can lead to a stack overflow. 
However, in this specific instance, the allocation size is small (100 bytes), which is unlikely to cause issues on its own.

2. Pointer Handling and Data Copy: The code correctly initializes the memory allocated by ALLOCA and ensures it is null-terminated. 
It then uses strncpy to copy data into this buffer, taking care to not exceed the buffer's size and explicitly null-terminates 
the buffer after copying. This careful handling avoids buffer overflow vulnerabilities during the copy operation.
