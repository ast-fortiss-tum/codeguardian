1. Buffer Overflow Protection: The function aims to prevent buffer overflows by ensuring that headerdataPtr + chars 
does not surpass the boundary of header.rawdata. This is a crucial check for memory safety and is a good practice 
to avoid writing beyond the allocated array.

2. Use of sizeof Operator: The use of sizeof(header.rawdata) to determine the size of the buffer is appropriate 
if header.rawdata is a statically sized array. This ensures that the calculation is based on the actual size of the buffer, 
not on the amount of data it currently contains.

3. Termination Character Insertion: Setting header.rawdata[sizeof(header.rawdata) - 1] = '\0'; 
before throwing the exception is an attempt to ensure that the data remains null-terminated. 
This is a defensive programming practice to keep the buffer in a valid state, even in error conditions.
