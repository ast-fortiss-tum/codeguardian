The function func() opens a file named “BadSource_fopen.txt” for writing and reading. 
If the file is successfully opened, it is assigned to the pointer data. 
The reference dataRef is then used to create another pointer to the same file.

The code checks if data is not NULL before attempting to close the file, 
which is a good practice as it prevents undefined behavior from occurring 
if fclose() were called with a NULL argument.
