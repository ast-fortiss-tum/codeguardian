1. The wcscat(data, L"file.txt") operation is performed on a buffer dataBuffer 
that is large enough (FILENAME_MAX size) to hold the base path and 
the file name “file.txt”. This prevents buffer overflow.

2. The string “file.txt” is always appended to the base path, resulting 
in a fixed file name. Using a fixed file name can prevent certain 
types of vulnerabilities related to file handling.

3. The file is opened with outputFile.open((char *)data), 
which opens the file for writing. It does not create any vulnerabilities 
as long as the file operations are handled correctly.

4. The file is properly closed after being opened, which is a good practice 
to prevent file descriptor leaks.
