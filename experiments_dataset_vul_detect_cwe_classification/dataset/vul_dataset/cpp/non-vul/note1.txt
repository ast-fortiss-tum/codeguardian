If data is less than CHAR_MAX, it increments data by 1 and assigns the result to result. 
The function then prints result as a hexadecimal character. 
If data is not less than CHAR_MAX, it prints a message indicating 
that the data value is too large to perform arithmetic safely.

This code is safe because it checks if data is less than 
CHAR_MAX before performing the increment operation. This check prevents an overflow, 
which could occur if data were equal to CHAR_MAX and then incremented.
