// This code is classified as CWE-120, which is a child of CWE-119.
The function strcpy is used to copy the string `str` into `buf`. 
However, there is no check to ensure that the length of str does not exceed BUFSIZE. 
If str is longer than BUFSIZE - 1 characters (accounting for the null terminator), 
it will lead to a buffer overflow. This can cause program crashes,
 data corruption, or even enable attackers to execute arbitrary code.
