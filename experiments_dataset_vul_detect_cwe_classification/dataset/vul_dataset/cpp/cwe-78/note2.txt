he function takes a map (dataMap) and uses its content (dataMap[2]) directly in an array of arguments (args) 
for the _spawnv function. If the map's data can be influenced by an attacker, they could inject malicious commands or arguments. 
This can lead to arbitrary code execution or manipulation of the behavior of the spawned process. 
It's crucial to validate and sanitize all external inputs used in process creation functions.
