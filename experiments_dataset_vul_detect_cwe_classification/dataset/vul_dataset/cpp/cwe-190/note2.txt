`char result = data * 2;`
If data is close to the maximum value a char can hold (typically 127 in signed char or 255 in unsigned char), 
multiplying it by 2 could cause an integer overflow. This means the value wraps around, 
leading to incorrect, unexpected results that are much smaller than the actual mathematical result.
