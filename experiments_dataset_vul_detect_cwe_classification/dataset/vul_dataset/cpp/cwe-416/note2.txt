The code allocates memory dynamically for data using malloc, initializes it, 
and then immediately frees it with free(data). 
Any subsequent attempt to access or use the data pointer after it has been freed will lead to undefined behavior, 
potentially causing a crash or exploitation by malicious code.

To mitigate this, ensure that the pointer is not accessed after it has been freed. 
If the data needs to be accessed later, do not free it until you are done using it. 
If you free the memory, set the pointer to NULL to avoid accidental use:
```
free(data);
data = NULL;  // Prevents use after free
```
