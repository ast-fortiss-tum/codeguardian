The data pointer is allocated memory using new[] and subsequently freed with delete[]. 
However, the code attempts to access data after it has been deleted, in the printIntLine function call. 
Accessing memory after it has been freed can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, data corruption, 
or potential security vulnerabilities.

To mitigate this, ensure that the pointer is not accessed after it has been freed. 
If the data needs to be accessed later, do not free it until you are done using it. 
If you free the memory, set the pointer to NULL to prevent accidental use:
```
delete [] data;
data = NULL;  // Prevents use after free
```
