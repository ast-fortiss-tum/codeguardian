- Vulnerability Detail:
The script checks if Logind::isAvailable() and mainConfig.Users.ReuseSession.get() return true. 
If so, it proceeds to list existing sessions using OrgFreedesktopLogin1ManagerInterface.
It then iterates through each session, checking if the session's user name matches the provided user. 
If a match is found and the service is "sddm", it stores the session ID.

- Problematic Scenario:
If an existing session ID is found, the script seems to unlock and activate this session without 
performing adequate authentication checks to ensure that the user initiating this request is indeed the legitimate owner of the session.
The authentication process, in this case, is bypassed or not sufficiently rigorous, which can allow 
an unauthorized user to gain access to another user's session.

"""Explanation for the fix (in code_after.cpp)"""
New Authentication Check: The lambda function connected to the Auth::authentication signal now includes
a bool success parameter. This parameter indicates whether the authentication was successful.
The revised code only proceeds to unlock and activate the existing session if success is true. 
This means that it checks whether the authentication (presumably via PAM, which is 
a standard authentication method in Unix and Linux systems) was successful before proceeding.
