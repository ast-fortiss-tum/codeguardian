// This script is classified as CWE-295, which is a child of CWE-287.
In the context of SSL/TLS security has a specific vulnerability.
By setting SSL_VERIFY_NONE, this line of code configures the SSL context 
to not perform any verification of the server certificate. 

This means that it will not check if the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, 
or if it is valid for the host it is presented by. 
This can leave the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
