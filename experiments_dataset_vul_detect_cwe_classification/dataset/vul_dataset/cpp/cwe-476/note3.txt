Setting Pointer to NULL: Initially, data is set to NULL (or nullptr in modern C++). 
This is fine on its own. However, the problem arises in the subsequent use of this pointer.

Dereferencing a NULL Pointer: The statement printIntLine(data->intOne) attempts to dereference data 
which is a NULL pointer. Dereferencing a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior, 
typically resulting in a runtime crash.

Deleting a NULL Pointer: While deleting a NULL pointer is safe in C++ and does not lead to undefined behavior, 
the intent behind deleting data seems incorrect since it was never allocated memory.


To fix these issues, you should ensure that data is either properly initialized to a valid object of TwoIntsClass 
before dereferencing or add checks to ensure that data is not NULL when attempting to access its members or delete it.

E.g.,

```
TwoIntsClass * data = new TwoIntsClass();
// ... use data ...
if(data != nullptr) {
    printIntLine(data->intOne);
    delete data;
}
```
