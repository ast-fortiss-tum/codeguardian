The getCurrentFileName() method gets the name of the current file in the ZIP archive, 
and absoluteFilePath(name) is used to construct the absolute path where the file will be extracted. 
However, there is no check to ensure that the extracted file's path is confined to the intended directory. 
An attacker could craft a ZIP file with a path that includes directory traversal sequences 
(like ../) in the filenames. When extracted, these files could end up being placed outside of the intended directory, 
potentially overwriting critical files or placing malicious files in sensitive directories.
