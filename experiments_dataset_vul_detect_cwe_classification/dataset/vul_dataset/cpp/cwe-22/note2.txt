The program directly uses the first command-line argument (argv[0]) to open a file without 
any validation or sanitization. This can be dangerous if the application is run 
in an environment where an attacker can influence the command-line arguments. 
An attacker could potentially provide a path to a sensitive file, 
leading to unauthorized disclosure of its contents. 

However, it's important to note that typically argv[0] is used to store the name of the program itself, 
and argv[1] is the first user-supplied argument. If the intention was to use user-supplied arguments, 
argv[1] should be used instead.
