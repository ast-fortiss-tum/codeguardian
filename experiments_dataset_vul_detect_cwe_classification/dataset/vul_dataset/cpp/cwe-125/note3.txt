`mapidata->data` is cast to a `DDWORD*` and then dereferenced to assign its value to `ddword_tmp`. 
The problem lies in the loop that follows, where the code iterates over `mapidata->data` assuming it's the same size as `ddword_tmp`. 
This is potentially dangerous because it assumes that `mapidata->data` has at least `sizeof(ddword_tmp)` bytes. 
If `mapidata->data` is smaller than this size, the loop will read beyond the end of `mapidata->data`, leading to undefined behavior.
