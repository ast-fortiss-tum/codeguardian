The `memchr` function is used to search for the first occurrence of 'x' in argv[0]. 
The third argument to `memchr` is MAX_PATH, which specifies the number of bytes to be searched. 

If argv[0] (the program's name) is shorter than MAX_PATH and does not contain a null terminator 
within the first MAX_PATH bytes, `memchr` may read beyond the bounds of the string. 
This could lead to undefined behavior, including reading from unallocated memory.
