SQL Injection: The method m_sql.safe_queryBlob is used to query the database, 
and it appears to insert the idx variable directly into the SQL query. 
If the safe_queryBlob method does not adequately sanitize or parameterize the input, 
this could lead to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the idx parameter to 
alter the SQL query, leading to unauthorized data access, data modification, or other malicious activities.

The use of atol(idx.c_str()) suggests an attempt to convert the idx value to a long integer,
which might mitigate SQL injection if idx is strictly a numeric value. However, 
without knowing the implementation details of safe_queryBlob, it's hard to confirm if this conversion is sufficient to prevent SQL injection.
