The username "scott" is hard-coded into the function call, and it seems like the password is intended to be an empty string, 
which is also hard-coded. This practice can lead to several security issues.

CWE-798 is a more precise categorization for your case than CWE-259, which is a broader category for any hard-coded data. 
CWE-798 directly addresses the security risks associated with hard-coding sensitive information like usernames and passwords, 
which are of particular concern in the context of authentication.
