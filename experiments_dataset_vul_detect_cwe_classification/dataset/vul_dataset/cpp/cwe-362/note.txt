CWE-362 is the parent of CWE-367, which means that CWE-367 is a specific instance or subtype of CWE-362.

CWE-362 represents the broader category of race conditions due to concurrent execution using shared resources with improper synchronization. 
It's a general category that encompasses various types of race conditions, including those arising from multithreading issues, 
shared resource access, and other scenarios where the timing of execution can lead to security vulnerabilities.

CWE-367 (TOCTOU Race Condition) is a specific type of race condition where the vulnerability arises due to a gap in time between 
checking the state of a resource (like file permissions) and using that resource (such as opening the file). This subtype falls 
under the broader category of CWE-362.


The access() function is used to check if the file can be written to.
However, there's a window of time between the check (access()) and the use (fopen()). During this window,
the state of the file or its permissions might change (e.g., it could be deleted, permissions could be altered,
or it might be replaced by a symlink to a critical system file).
If such a change occurs, your program might behave unexpectedly or insecurely when it operates on the file, 
leading to security vulnerabilities.
