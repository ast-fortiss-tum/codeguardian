    Unsanitized Input Insertion: The variables sdesc, aux, and si are directly concatenated into the HTML content without any form of escaping or sanitization. 
    If any of these variables contain user-supplied data, it could lead to XSS attacks. 
    For instance, an attacker could craft a malicious string that, when inserted into the HTML, 
    executes unwanted JavaScript code in the browser of any user viewing this error message.

    HTML Injection: The method directly injects values into the HTML structure, which can be exploited for HTML injection attacks. 
    This can lead to modifications in the page layout, unauthorized content display, and in combination with script execution, more severe XSS attacks.
