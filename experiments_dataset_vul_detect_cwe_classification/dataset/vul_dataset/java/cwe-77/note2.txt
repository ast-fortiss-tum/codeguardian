The vulnerability arises from concatenating the foldername variable directly into 
the IMAP command string ("CREATE " + foldername). If an attacker can manipulate 
the folder parameter in the request, they could potentially inject additional IMAP commands or arguments.
For example, if foldername is provided as "INBOX\" EXPUNGE", it might lead to unexpected behavior 
like deleting messages, depending on how the IMAP server processes the command.
