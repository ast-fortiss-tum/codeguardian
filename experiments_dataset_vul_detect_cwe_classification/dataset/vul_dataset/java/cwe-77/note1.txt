The method checkConnection takes a UrlArgument object (repoUrl) as a parameter.
This URL is directly used in constructing a command line argument (withArg(repoUrl)).
If the UrlArgument object is not properly sanitized and can be influenced by an external user,
it may be possible for an attacker to inject additional commands or alter the intended command.
