In this script, the vulnerability is evident in the following section:

ObjectInputStream in = new LookAheadObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(objectArray));
data = in.readObject();

Here, objectArray is being deserialized without proper validation or sanitization.
This could allow an attacker to manipulate the serialized data to execute arbitrary code 
or cause other malicious outcomes when it is deserialized.
