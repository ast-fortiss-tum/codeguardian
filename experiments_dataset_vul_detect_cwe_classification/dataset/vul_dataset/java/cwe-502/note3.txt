When you use JmsInvokerServiceExporter, it exposes a service interface for remote invocation over JMS, 
which inherently involves deserialization of incoming messages. 
If an attacker is able to send maliciously crafted messages to this service, 
and the application deserializes these without adequate checks, 
it could lead to various attacks, including remote code execution.
