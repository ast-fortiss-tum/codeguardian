The code is creating an ObjectInputStream from a file and then deserializing an object from it, 
casting it to javax.swing.JButton. This is potentially dangerous because 
if the contents of "object.obj" are maliciously crafted, they could exploit vulnerabilities 
in the classes available to the Java process. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code, 
cause a denial of service, or gain access to sensitive data.
