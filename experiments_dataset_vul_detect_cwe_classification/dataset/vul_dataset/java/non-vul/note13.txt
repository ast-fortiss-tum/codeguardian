It’s using a SecureRandom object to generate a random integer, which is then used 
in a switch statement to determine the value of a string. 
The string is then written to an output stream.

The use of SecureRandom is a good practice when generating random numbers, 
as it provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG).
