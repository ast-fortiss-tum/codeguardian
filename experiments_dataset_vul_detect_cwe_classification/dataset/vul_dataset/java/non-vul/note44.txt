The method throws a generic Throwable at the beginning, which is not a good practice because it can catch and throw everything 
including Errors which you normally wouldn't want to handle. The exception message includes the absolute path of 
the directory that could not be created, which might lead to information disclosure if this exception message is logged 
or shown to an end-user without proper handling.
