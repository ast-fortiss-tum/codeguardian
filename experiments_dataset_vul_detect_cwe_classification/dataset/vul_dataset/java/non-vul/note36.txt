The code correctly demonstrates the use of exception handling in Java. 
An UnsupportedOperationException is explicitly thrown and then caught within the same method. 
The catch block handles the exception by printing a generic error message, 
which is a good practice for avoiding the disclosure of sensitive information about the application's internal workings.
