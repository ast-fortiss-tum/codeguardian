1. Use of SecureRandom: The SecureRandom class is a part of Java's standard library and is designed to generate cryptographically 
strong random numbers. Unlike Random, it is secure against prediction, making it suitable for use in security-sensitive applications. 
Therefore, the choice of SecureRandom is appropriate for scenarios where you need strong randomness, such as generating tokens, 
passwords, or other security-sensitive information.
