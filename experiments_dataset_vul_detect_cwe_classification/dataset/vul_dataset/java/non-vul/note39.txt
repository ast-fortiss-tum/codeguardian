1. Strong Encryption Algorithm and Key Length: The code uses AES with a 256-bit key, 
which is considered strong and secure for cryptographic purposes. 
AES is widely recognized and recommended for secure data encryption.

2. Secure Key Generation: The use of KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES") with keyGenerator.init(256) for 
generating a 256-bit AES key is a cryptographically secure method for key generation. 
This ensures that the key has high entropy and is suitable for secure encryption.

3. Appropriate Use of SecretKeySpec: The SecretKeySpec is correctly used to specify the key for the AES encryption process. 
This is a standard and secure practice in Java for converting byte arrays into keys specific for cryptographic operations.
