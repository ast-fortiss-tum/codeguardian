1. Exception Handling: The code correctly handles IOException which might occur 
during writing the response.

2. Resource Management: The PrintWriter is properly closed in a finally block, 
ensuring the resource is freed regardless of whether an exception occurs.

3. HTML Form: The code writes an HTML form to the response. 
The form action is set to a specific URL and it uses the POST method. 
It includes fields for a username and a password.
