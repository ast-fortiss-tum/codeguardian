Control Flow: The code uses a conditional statement to decide between 
two branches of execution. If PRIVATE_STATIC_FINAL_FALSE is true, it writes a benign string. 
Otherwise, it enters a loop.

Loop: In the loop, it checks if count equals 20000 and if so, writes a message 
about license expiration. The loop continues until count reaches Integer.MAX_VALUE.

No Backdoor: The comment indicates that there’s no backdoor in this code, 
which means there are no hidden parts of the code that could allow unauthorized access 
or control.
