1. The if (false) statement will never execute its block of code, so the IO.writeLine("Benign, fixed string"); 
line is effectively unreachable.

2. In the else block, the System.getProperty("CWE395") is used to get a system property. 
If the property doesn’t exist, System.getProperty() will return null.

3. The code checks if systemProperty is null before calling equals(). This prevents a NullPointerException from being thrown, 
which would be a potential vulnerability.

4. If systemProperty is null, it correctly handles this case by writing "systemProperty is null" to the line.

5. If systemProperty is not null, it checks if the property equals "CWE395". If it does, it writes "systemProperty is CWE395" to the line.
