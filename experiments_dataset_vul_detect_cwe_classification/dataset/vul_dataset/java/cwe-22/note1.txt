The most directly relevant weakness this function is addressing is path traversal.
By checking for sequences that are commonly used to navigate through directories in a filesystem, 
the function aims to prevent unauthorized access to files or directories outside the intended directory structure. 
This is a common concern in web applications where user input might influence file paths.
