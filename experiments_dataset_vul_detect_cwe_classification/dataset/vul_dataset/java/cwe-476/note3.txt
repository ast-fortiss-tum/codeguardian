The variable data is explicitly set to null in both branches of the first if-else statement. 
Later, within another conditional check, there's an attempt to call toString() 
on data without verifying if it is non-null. This can lead to a NullPointerException at runtime. 
Such exceptions can cause unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.
