Issue: The method writes data to the external storage of a device. 
External storage is generally world-readable, meaning that data saved there 
can be accessed by any other application installed on the same device. 
This could lead to unauthorized read access to the data written by this method.

Impact: If sensitive information is written using this method, it could be exposed to other applications, 
leading to a potential breach of confidentiality.

Mitigation: Consider the following suggestions:
1. Use Internal Storage: If the data is sensitive, consider using internal storage which is private to the application. 
This storage area is more secure as other apps cannot access it.
2. Apply Appropriate Permissions: If external storage is necessary, ensure that you set appropriate file permissions. 
For instance, use MODE_PRIVATE to restrict access.
3. Encryption: If the data must be stored in external storage and can be sensitive, encrypt the data before writing it.
