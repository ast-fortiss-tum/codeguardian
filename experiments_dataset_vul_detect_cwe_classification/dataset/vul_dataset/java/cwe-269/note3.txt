The method printDebugInfo checks if the user is authenticated and then uses a switch statement 
to allow everyone except guests to access debug information. 
This suggests that regular users (USER) are granted the same privilege as administrators (ADMIN) regarding access to debug information.

This could lead to a situation where regular users have access to potentially sensitive or internal system information, 
which should typically be restricted to administrators. Allowing broader access 
than necessary can lead to security risks, such as information disclosure or exploitation of system vulnerabilities.
