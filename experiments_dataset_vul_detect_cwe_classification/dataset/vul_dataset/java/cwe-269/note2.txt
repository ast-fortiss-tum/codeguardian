CWE-269 concerns the management and assignment of privileges in a system. 
In your code, while there are checks for user roles, the actual privilege management, 
particularly for the resetPassword operation, seems to be overly reliant 
on user roles without adequate checks or constraints.

This could lead to scenarios where a user with a certain role (like OPERATOR) might have 
more privileges than intended, such as resetting passwords, which ideally might be a privilege reserved only for ADMIN users.
