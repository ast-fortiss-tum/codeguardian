The vulnerability is in parts of the code:

"productCategory = '" + productCategory + "' and customerID = '" + customerID + "'"
and
"'" + sortColumn + "'asc"

In these lines, productCategory, customerID, and sortColumn are variables 
that are directly used to construct the SQL query. If these variables are derived 
from user input and are not properly sanitized, an attacker could manipulate them 
to alter the query's structure, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
