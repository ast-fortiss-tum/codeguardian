The primary concern is with getStringParameterSQL. 
This method directly concatenates the parameter value into a SQL string: return "'" + param + "'";. 
If param contains SQL control characters or commands, it could be used to modify the SQL query, leading to SQL Injection.


"""EXplanation of the fixed code"""
The updated getStringParameterSQL method in your Java code includes an attempt to 
mitigate SQL Injection risks by escaping single quotes in string parameters:

@Override
public String getStringParameterSQL(String param) {
    // DASHBUILDE-113: SQL Injection on data set lookup filters
    String escapedParam = param.replaceAll("'", "''");
    return "'" + escapedParam + "'";
}

This change replaces each single quote (') in the input string with two single quotes (''), 
which is a common method for escaping single quotes in SQL. 
This approach can help prevent some forms of SQL Injection where the attacker tries to terminate the string literal
and inject additional SQL code.
