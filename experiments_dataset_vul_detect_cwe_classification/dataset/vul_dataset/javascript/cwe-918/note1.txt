Extracting and Using Untrusted Data:
The function extracts the protocol, IP address, and port from the 'command' object. This data is used to establish a network connection.
If the command object can be influenced by external input (e.g., user input, API request), 
it poses a risk. An attacker could provide a malicious command to make the server connect to an undesirable or harmful destination.

Lack of Validation and Sanitization:
There is no evident validation or sanitization of the extracted data (protocol, ip, port). This is critical for SSRF prevention.
Without proper checks, the function might inadvertently connect to internal services (like databases, administrative interfaces), 
URLs with a different protocol (like file:// or dict://), or external sites that could be used for further attacks.
