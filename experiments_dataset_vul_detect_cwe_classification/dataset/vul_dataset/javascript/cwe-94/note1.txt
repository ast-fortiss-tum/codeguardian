This weakness occurs when data is used to construct code that is then executed by the application. 
In this case, the Function(src) constructor dynamically executes code contained in the src variable. 
This can lead to serious security risks, especially if the content of src can be influenced by an external user, 
leading to arbitrary code execution.

There is no solution (fixed code) in CVEfixes dataset.
