The code dynamically creates a template based on req.params['template'], which is user-supplied data. 
The _.template function from Lodash compiles a string into a template function, which is then executed. 
If an attacker can control the template parameter, they might inject malicious code that will be executed 
on the server when the template function is called. This can lead to server-side code injection vulnerabilities, 
where an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to serious security breaches 
like data leakage, data manipulation, and unauthorized access.
