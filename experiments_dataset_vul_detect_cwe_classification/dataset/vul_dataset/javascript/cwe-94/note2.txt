In this code, $interpolate is used to dynamically evaluate the expression provided in $stateParams.expression. 
Since $stateParams typically contains data from the URL, it can be manipulated by an attacker. 
If the expression includes malicious AngularJS code, it can lead to code injection, 
where the attacker can execute arbitrary AngularJS expressions within the scope of your application. 
This might lead to a variety of attacks, including but not limited to data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
