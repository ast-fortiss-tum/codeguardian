1. Checks if o is falsy (null, undefined, etc.) and returns false if so.
2. Checks if o is an instance of Object but not an instance of any type in the safeTypes array.
3. Checks the type of o against the safeInstances array.
4. Checks for a special property _toExpand set to false.
5. Finally, returns true if o.toString() returns '[object Object]'.

Overall, the isPlainObject function seems to be designed with safety in mind, 
particularly in preventing the processing of non-plain objects that could lead 
to unwanted side effects
