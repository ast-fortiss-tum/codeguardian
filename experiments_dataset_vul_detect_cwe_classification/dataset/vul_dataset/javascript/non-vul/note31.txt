1. Use of Safe YAML Parsing: The function uses YAML.safeLoad for parsing the YAML content, 
which is a good practice. YAML.safeLoad is designed to safely parse a YAML string, 
minimizing risks like arbitrary code execution which can occur with YAML.load if the YAML file 
contains malicious content. The option to use YAML.load is provided but is gated behind 
the yamlOptions.unsafeLoad condition, suggesting an awareness of the associated risks.

2. Exception Handling: The function properly handles exceptions during the YAML parsing process.
