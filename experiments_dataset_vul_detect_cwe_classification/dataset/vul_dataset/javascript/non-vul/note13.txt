The function seems to be designed to mitigate security risks 
rather than containing vulnerabilities itself. It aims to prevent a certain class 
of attacks known as "code injection" or "Remote Code Execution (RCE)" attacks 
in AngularJS expressions. Such attacks can occur if an attacker can influence 
the Angular expressions evaluated by the application, leading to arbitrary code execution.
