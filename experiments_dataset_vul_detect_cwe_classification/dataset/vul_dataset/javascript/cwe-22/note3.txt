The function checks if the filePath leads to a directory traversal attempt 
by checking if the relative path between this.path and the full file path (fullPath) 
starts with ../. This is a fundamental check to prevent path traversal attacks, 
where an attacker could access files outside of the intended directory. 
However, this check might not be foolproof. Advanced path traversal techniques, 
like using encoded or non-standard path separators, might bypass this simple regex check.
