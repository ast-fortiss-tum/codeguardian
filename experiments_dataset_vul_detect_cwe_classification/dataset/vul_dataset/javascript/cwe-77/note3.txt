// The code has CWE-78 vulnerability, which is has a parent of CWE-77.
The backuptype parameter from the request URL is directly concatenated with a command string 
("c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat" + btype) to form the cmd variable.
This cmd variable is then executed by cp.exec. If an attacker can manipulate the backuptype query 
parameter in the request URL, they might inject arbitrary commands which will be executed on the server.
