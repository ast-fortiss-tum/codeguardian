Command Injection: The function constructs a shell command by directly incorporating the hostname variable into the command string. 
If the hostname variable can be controlled by an attacker, they may be able to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the server. 
This is a classic example of a command injection vulnerability.


"""Explanation for the fixed version (code_after.js)"""
Validation of hostname: The function now checks the validity of hostname using isValidHostName(hostname). 
Assuming isValidHostName is implemented correctly, this should ensure that only valid hostnames are passed to the shell command, 
reducing the risk of command injection through the hostname parameter.

Validation of type: The function checks if type is defined and whether it is one of the valid record types (RRecordTypes). 
This validation step is crucial if type is also included in the command line, as it prevents arbitrary values from being injected.
