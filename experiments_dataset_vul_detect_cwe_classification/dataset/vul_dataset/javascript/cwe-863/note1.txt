The vulnerability in this script appears to be related to how it constructs a URL to make a request to the Facebook Graph API.

he key issue is in the line:
'''
.get(`https://graph.facebook.com/${id}`)
'''
Here, the id variable is directly inserted into the URL. If id is user-supplied and not properly validated or sanitized, 
this could lead to an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs 
when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. 
In this case, if the id is manipulated by an attacker, they might be able to access data they are not authorized to, 
such as images from other Facebook users.
