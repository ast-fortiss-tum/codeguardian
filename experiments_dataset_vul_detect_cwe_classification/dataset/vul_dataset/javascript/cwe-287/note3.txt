// This code has CWE-295 vulnerability, which has a parent of CWE-287 vulnerability.
The vulnerability in the provided script is related to SSL/TLS security. 
The specific issue is with the line rejectUnauthorized: false. 
This line of code disables TLS/SSL certificate validation.
When this option is set to false, it allows the application to accept any SSL certificate, 
even if it is invalid or self-signed. This makes the application vulnerable 
to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept the communication 
and present a fraudulent certificate, leading to potentially sensitive data being exposed or compromised.

In the script, the primary issue is with certificate validation (CWE-295), 
which is a specific form of authentication failure under the broader category of CWE-287.
