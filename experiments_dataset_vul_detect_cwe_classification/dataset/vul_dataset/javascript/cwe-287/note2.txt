The potential vulnerability here relates to the requestCert option being set to true. 
When requestCert is true, the server requests a certificate from clients that connect 
and attempts to verify that certificate. However, this script does not specify 
how the server should handle a situation where the client does not provide a certificate 
or provides an invalid certificate.
