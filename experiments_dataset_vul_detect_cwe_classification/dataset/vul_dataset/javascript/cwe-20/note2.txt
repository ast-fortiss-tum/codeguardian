The code does not adequately validate or sanitize the input string before processing it. 
This could lead to various types of attacks, such as injection attacks, 
if the input is maliciously crafted. For instance, the function modifies the input string with replace() 
and substring() methods but does not perform sufficient checks to ensure that the input format is as expected.
