Lack of Input Validation: The script directly uses input from the URL (document.URL.substring(...)) 
without validating or encoding it. This means if the URL contains malicious JavaScript code as part 
of the eid parameter, that code will be executed in the context of the user's browser.

Use of document.write(): This method writes directly to the HTML document, executing any script tags it encounters. 
This behavior further exacerbates the XSS vulnerability because it allows the execution of potentially malicious scripts.
