In your code, element is obtained from getUntrustedInput() and then directly used within ReactDOM.render(). 
If getUntrustedInput() can return a string that contains malicious JavaScript code, and if this string is
not properly sanitized or escaped, an attacker could inject script content that gets executed in the context of your web page. 
This can lead to various security issues such as stealing user cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the users.
