The code snippet you've shared is using the pbkdf2_hmac function from Python's hashlib module. 
This function is generally used for deriving a secure key from a password, using a hash function ('sha256' in your case), 
a password, a salt, and an iteration count. However, there's a significant issue in your code: the password is set as an empty string ('').
