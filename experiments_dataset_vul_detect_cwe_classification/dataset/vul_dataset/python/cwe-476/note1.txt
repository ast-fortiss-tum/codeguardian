# Reason:
1. Dynamic Typing and Automatic Memory Management: Python is a dynamically typed language with automatic memory management.
This means that the language runtime automatically handles memory allocation and garbage collection, 
reducing the likelihood of low-level memory access issues common in languages like C or C++.

2. 'None' in Python: In Python, the equivalent of a null pointer is None. 
However, attempting to access an attribute of None or calling a method on None results in a TypeError 
rather than a segmentation fault or a crash caused by a null pointer dereference. 
Python's runtime catches such cases and throws an exception, which can be handled within the Python code.
