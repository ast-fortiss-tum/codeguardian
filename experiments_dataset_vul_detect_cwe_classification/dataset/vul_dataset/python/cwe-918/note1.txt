The modified remote_cors function in your code snippet attempts to mitigate the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918) by adding a check through the controllers.check_session_tracks function. This check seems to be designed to validate whether the remote_url is permitted for the current session, which is a step in the right direction to prevent SSRF attacks.
