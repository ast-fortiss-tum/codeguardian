The function takes a URL from recipe.link and makes an HTTP request to that URL. 
If recipe.link is controllable by an external user or not properly validated, 
it could be exploited to make the server send requests to unintended URLs. 
This could lead to information disclosure, interaction with internal services, 
or other unintended actions by the server.
