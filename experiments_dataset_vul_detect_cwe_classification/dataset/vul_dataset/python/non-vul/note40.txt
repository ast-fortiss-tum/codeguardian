The function uses defusedxml for parsing the XML string, which is a good security practice. defusedxml is a Python library 
specifically designed to mitigate security risks associated with XML parsing, such as XML external entity (XXE) attacks and billion laughs attacks. 
By using defusedxml, the function avoids common vulnerabilities often found when using standard XML parsing libraries like xml.etree.ElementTree.
