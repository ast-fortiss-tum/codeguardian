Original Code:
'''
dec = "%s %s -d %s --deobf" % (self.jadx, dex, self.tempdir)
os.system(dec)
'''

Updated Code:
'''
args = [self.jadx, dex, "-d", self.tempdir, "--deobf"]
comm = "%s" % (" ".join(quote(arg) for arg in args))
os.system(comm)
'''

The updated code improves upon the original by:

1. Using a List to Hold Arguments: It constructs a list of command-line arguments, 
which is a cleaner and more manageable approach.
2. Quoting Arguments: The use of quote on each argument is a crucial improvement. 
This function (assuming it's similar to shlex.quote) provides a way to escape shell-special 
characters in the command, thereby reducing the risk of command injection. 
This makes the code safer against scenarios where an attacker might control or influence parts of the command, 
such as self.jadx, dex, or self.tempdir.
