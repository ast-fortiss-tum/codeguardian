In this case, the vulnerability would allow an attacker to inject additional SMTP commands 
into the session.docmd() call if the 'user' parameter is not properly sanitized. 
This could potentially be exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the SMTP server 
or even lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

SMTP command injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker may influence the commands sent to an SMTP mail server. 
1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source. 
2. The data is used as or as part of a string representing a command that is executed by the application. 
3. By executing the SMTP command, the attacker is able to instruct the server to carry out malicious actions such as sending spam. 

Example 1: The following code uses an HTTP request parameter to craft a VRFY command that is sent to the SMTP server. 
An attacker may use this parameter to modify the command sent to the server and inject new commands using CRLF characters.
