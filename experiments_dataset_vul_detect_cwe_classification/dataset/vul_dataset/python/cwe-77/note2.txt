## Recognized the vulnerability as CWE-78, which has a parent CWE-77 -> Thus, the vulnerability can be also classified as CWE-77.
The most prominent issue here is related to CWE-78, which involves the injection of unintended commands through manipulating input. 
The os.system(cmd) function is used to execute a system command. 
If INITCMD (which is appended to the home directory) can be influenced by user input or an external source, 
it could potentially lead to command injection. An attacker could craft INITCMD in a way that appends additional commands to cmd, 
leading to the execution of arbitrary system commands.
