href Variable: This variable is used to construct the command to be executed. If href comes from an untrusted source (like user input or an external entity) and is not properly sanitized, it could be used to inject malicious commands. The script attempts to mitigate this by using urllib.parse.urlparse(href).path and os.path.basename(tmppath) to extract a safe path from the URL, and it uses shlex.quote to escape it if href is directly appended to the command. This is good practice and helps to prevent command injection through the href variable.
