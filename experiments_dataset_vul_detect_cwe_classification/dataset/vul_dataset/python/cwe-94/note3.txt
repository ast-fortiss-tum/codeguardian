The code snippet is vulnerable due to the use of the eval function, which takes a string argument and executes it as Python code. 
This is a potentially dangerous operation if the input is not properly sanitized, as it allows for arbitrary code execution. 
The vulnerability lies in the fact that eval is used to dynamically construct a class name based on unvalidated input from data. 
If an attacker is able to control the input to the data dictionary, they could execute arbitrary code on the system where the Python code is running.


### Fixed code ###
The revised code attempts to mitigate the CWE-94 vulnerability by replacing the use of eval with a safer approach for dynamic import and 
object instantiation based on user input. It uses import_module from the importlib library to dynamically import a module based on the input in data and getattr to retrieve an attribute 
(in this case, a class) by name from the imported module. This is a safer method compared to directly evaluating potentially untrusted input as code.
