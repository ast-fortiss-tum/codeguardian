In the code, template = request.GET['template'] takes a template string directly from the request's GET parameter and 
creates a new Jinja2 template with it (Jinja2_Template(template)). This is potentially dangerous because it allows users to supply arbitrary templates, which can lead to SSTI.
If an attacker can control the template, they might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server, depending on the template engine's features and the server's configuration.

How SSTI Occurs:
Consider an attacker providing a template string that includes malicious code or commands. 
Since the template engine processes this string, it could execute unintended commands or code on the server.
