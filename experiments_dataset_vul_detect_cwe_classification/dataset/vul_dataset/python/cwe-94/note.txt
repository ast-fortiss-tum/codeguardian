The eval function dynamically executes code constructed from user input (node.func.id + expr). 
If an attacker can control the input to node.args, they could potentially inject arbitrary code that would be executed by eval. 
This could lead to various security issues, including unauthorized access, data leakage, or server compromise.

The critical part here is the dynamic construction of a string that includes node.func.id and expr, 
where expr is built from the contents of node.args. Since node.func.id is checked against a whitelist ('ObjectId', 'datetime'), 
the primary vector for injection would be through manipulating node.args to break out of the intended data context and inject arbitrary Python expressions or commands.


### Updated version of the code ###
This solution eliminates the use of the eval function, which was the primary source of the vulnerability in the original code. 
Instead, it directly calls the ObjectId and datetime constructors with the parameters extracted from node.args, 
significantly reducing the risk of arbitrary code execution.
