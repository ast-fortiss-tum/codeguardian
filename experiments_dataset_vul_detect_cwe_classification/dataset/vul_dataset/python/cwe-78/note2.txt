It uses os.system(dec) to execute a system command. This method is vulnerable to command injection 
if any part of the command string can be influenced by an external input. 
In this case, variables like self.jadx, dex, and self.tempdir could potentially be manipulated to inject malicious commands. 
To mitigate this risk, consider using more secure alternatives like subprocess.run(), 
which offers better control over command arguments and can prevent command injection.
