The script you've presented has a vulnerability related to the use of the os.system function for executing a system command. 
Specifically, the line cmd = "del " + image_file constructs a command string using the image_file variable 
and then executes this command. If the image_file variable can be influenced by an external input, 
it may lead to Command Injection.


"""Explanation of the fixed code (code_after3.py)"""
The updated code you provided attempts to mitigate the CWE-78 by using 
werkzeug.utils.secure_filename on the image_file variable. 
This function is designed to secure a filename by removing any potentially 
dangerous characters, which can help prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
