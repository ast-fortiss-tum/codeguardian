Use of cPickle for Deserialization (CWE-502): The use of cPickle.loads for deserializing data is potentially dangerous. 
cPickle is known for being vulnerable to arbitrary code execution during deserialization. If an attacker can control the serialized data, 
they can execute arbitrary code on the system where the deserialization is taking place. This is a critical vulnerability and should be addressed immediately.

Recommendation: Use a safer serialization format like JSON, or if complex objects must be serialized, 
ensure that the serialization format does not allow arbitrary code execution. 
For instance, you can use pickle with a restricted loader, or better, use json.loads if the data format allows.
