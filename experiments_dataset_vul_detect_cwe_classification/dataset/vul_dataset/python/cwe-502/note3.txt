The function import_bookmarks allows a user to select a file to import bookmarks from.
The chosen file is opened and its contents are directly deserialized using json.load(fileobj).
There is no check to ensure that the deserialized data is safe or has the expected structure, 
other than a very basic check for the presence of a 'title' key in each bookmark.
