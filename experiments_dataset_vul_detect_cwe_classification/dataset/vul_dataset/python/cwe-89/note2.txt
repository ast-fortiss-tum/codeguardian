The $where operator allows you to pass a JavaScript expression or function as a query. 
In your code, you're directly concatenating user input (userName and emailId) into this expression. 
This practice is inherently insecure as it can be exploited for injection attacks, where an attacker could insert malicious code.
Although it's a NoSQL injection in this context, the principles and risks are similar to SQL injection.
