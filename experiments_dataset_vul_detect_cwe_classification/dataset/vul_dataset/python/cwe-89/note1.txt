The use of string interpolation with 

"SELECT term FROM terms WHERE term > \"{floor}\" AND term < \"{ceiling}\" AND term LIKE \"{word}%%\" ORDER BY length(term),term LIMIT {requested_limit}" 

and other similar lines directly incorporate user input (word, floor, ceiling, and requested_limit) into the SQL query. 
If an attacker can control the input to manipulate these variables, they could potentially inject malicious SQL commands.
