In your code, userName and itemName are directly appended to the SQL query string. 
If these variables contain SQL commands (which a malicious user can input), 
they can alter the intended query logic. This can lead to unauthorized data access, 
data manipulation, or even database structure alteration.

How SQL Injection Occurs:
For example, if userName is set to something like admin'; DROP TABLE items;--, 
the resulting query could delete your items table.
