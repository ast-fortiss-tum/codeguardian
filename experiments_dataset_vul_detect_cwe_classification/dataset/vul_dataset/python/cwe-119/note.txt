CWE-119, which refers to "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer," 
is more commonly associated with vulnerabilities in languages that require manual memory management, 
such as C or C++. This category includes buffer overflows, buffer over-reads, and similar issues 
where the program accesses memory outside the bounds of allocated memory buffers.

In Python, memory management is handled by the Python interpreter, which significantly reduces the risk of CWE-119 vulnerabilities. 
Python's data structures like strings, lists, and dictionaries are dynamically sized, and Python performs bounds checking 
on arrays and other data structures. As a result, traditional buffer overflow vulnerabilities are far less common 
in Python compared to languages with manual memory management.
