The script initializes arrays with very large negative numbers (-1250999896764). 
If these indices are used to access or modify an array or a buffer, it could lead to an out-of-bounds write. 
This occurs when the program writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. 
This can lead to data corruption, a crash, or code execution vulnerabilities. It's crucial to validate that indices 
or pointer arithmetic do not result in accesses outside of buffer boundaries.
