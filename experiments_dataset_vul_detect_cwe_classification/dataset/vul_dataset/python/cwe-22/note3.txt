The filename is constructed using a value from CONFIG_TXT['sub']. 
If CONFIG_TXT['sub'] can be influenced by user input or another external source, 
it might be possible for an attacker to craft a value that includes path traversal characters 
(like ../ in Unix-like systems). This could potentially allow access to files outside of the intended directory.
