# This code is classified as CWWE-274, which has a parent of CWE-269.
While CWE-274 is a more specific classification directly related to the script's failure 
to ensure privileges are dropped, CWE-269 is a broader classification that 
includes any kind of mismanagement of privileges, 
including the scenario presented in your script.

: The function raisePrivileges() presumably elevates the script's privileges (perhaps to root or administrator level), 
which is necessary to create a directory in /home/. After creating the directory with os.mkdir('/home/' + username), 
it attempts to lower the privileges back to their original level with lowerPrivileges().

Potential for Privilege Escalation: If an error occurs between the raisePrivileges() and lowerPrivileges() calls, 
and this error is not handled appropriately, the script may exit without ever lowering the privileges. 
This can leave the script running with elevated privileges longer than necessary, potentially allowing 
other parts of the system or malicious actors to exploit these elevated privileges.
