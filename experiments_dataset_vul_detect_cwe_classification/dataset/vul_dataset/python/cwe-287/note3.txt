The code snippet makes HTTP GET requests to a specified URL (https://example.domain) using Python's requests library, 
with the verify parameter explicitly set to False. This parameter controls the verification of the SSL certificate presented by the server, 
and setting it to False disables SSL certificate validation.

Disabling SSL certificate validation is a significant security risk as it makes the HTTP requests vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. 
An attacker could intercept the communication between the client and the server, potentially gaining access to any data transmitted, 
including sensitive information.
