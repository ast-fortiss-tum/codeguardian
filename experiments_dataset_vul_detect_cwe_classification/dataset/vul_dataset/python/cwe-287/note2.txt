# The code is recognized as CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation, which is a child of CWE-287: Improper Authentication.
In the snippet ssl_sock = ssl.wrap_socket(s), it's not clear if the default settings of ssl.wrap_socket are being overridden or not.
By default, ssl.wrap_socket does not verify the server's certificate, which means it does not check if the certificate 
is signed by a trusted certificate authority, if it has expired, or if it's valid for the given hostname.
